    tools used to test the Go Doctor:


gopatient-helper-download       "go get" the top GitHub projects using Go

gopatient-helper-find-runnable  List packages containing "func main()"
gopatient-helper-check-runnable <- or only those on which "go install" succeeds
gopatient-helper-find-testable  List all packages containing *_test.go files
gopatient-helper-check-testable <- or only those on which "go test" succeeds

gopatient-plan                  Generate a Makefile for testing a refactoring


    See HOWTO for how to use these tools in a typical testing scenario.
